# Super Mario Kart ZX Web Port
A Web Port of Super Mario Kart ZX, which is a remake of the Original Super Mario Kart for the SNES!

Demo Site: https://burnedpopcorn.github.io/SM-Kart-ZX-Web-Port/index.html

Source Code and Web Build can be Downloaded in Releases

## Current Issues
There are Issues, such as:
- When Quiting a Course, the next room that loads displays in black
- In pause menu and in Grand Prix, restart option that should only be selectable in Time Trail can still be accessed in Grand Prix

## Thanks to
@GithubSPerez for the Original Source Code
